Figma your Life
created a figma about our interests and accomplishments and then turned it into a web page

This has been Peer Reviewed by Gianpaolo Reinares:
Site is pretty good; Personally I would have all three page options on the navbar but that is just me; I would suggest to add some padding to the bottom of the page;  Would suggest adding 'background-size: cover;' in order to stretch your background image when the accordion functions are oppened; Also, are the accordions in the accomplishments page meant to be open or not? Besides that, everything looks fine.
